Wildfires pose a significant threat to biodiversity, air quality, and human life. Traditional detection methods are often delayed or limited in scale. This project introduces an AI-powered, cloud-based wildfire detection pipeline that processes satellite images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify fire-prone areas with high accuracy.
